7. When committing the code via `git commit` command. Write the commit messages with the following prefix so we can understand from your commit message what is that you worked on.

   * if it is a **feature** you are working on then the commit message should have the following prefix `feat/`.
   * if it a **fix** you are working on then the commit message should have the following prefix `fix/`. (here fix means that you have fixed some bug in the code)
